# Project AI Assistant Working Guidelines

Always prioritize the use of built-in tools and MCP tools to assist with tasks.

## Non-Negotiable Requirements
1. Always review the existing code (covering both frontend and backend); analyze, organize, and confirm the requirements (clearly define scope, dependencies, impact areas, and risks).
2. When information is insufficient, use built-in online tools or MCP tools to gather and validate information, and record key sources and conclusions.
3. Solution design must align with the project's current reality, explicitly considering the existing frontend and backend implementations and constraints; provide a short-term Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and a mid-to-long-term evolution plan, explaining trade-offs.
4. Before implementation, produce a complete task list (with executable granularity and acceptance criteria); after completing each phase, provide a follow-up recommended task list.

## Operating Principles
- Strictly minimize the change scope; modify only files directly related to the task.
- For new dependencies or breaking changes, present them in the proposal first and obtain approval.
- Prefer built-in tools and MCP tools for search, execution, generation, and verification to ensure reproducibility and rollback.

**Most Important: Always respond in Simplified Chinese.**
